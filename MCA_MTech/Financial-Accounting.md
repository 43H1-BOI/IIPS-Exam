## The following information is obtained from A Co. Ltd., in a certain year 
Sales Rs. 100000
Fixed Cost Rs. 30000
Variable Cost Rs. 60000
â€” Find the P/V Ratio, Break even point sales and margin of safety at this level.
Calculate the effect of
1. 20% increase in Selling price.
2. 10% decrease in Selling price.
3. 10% decrease in Fixed costs.
4. 10% decrease in Variable costs
5. 10% increase in Sales volume.

### Definitions and Formulae:

1. **Profit-Volume (P/V) Ratio**: It measures the contribution margin per unit of sales.  
   $\[
   \text{P/V Ratio} = \frac{\text{Sales} - \text{Variable Cost}}{\text{Sales}} \times 100
   \]$

2. **Break-Even Point (BEP) Sales**: The sales level at which total revenue equals total cost (no profit, no loss).  
   $\[
   \text{BEP Sales} = \frac{\text{Fixed Cost}}{\text{P/V Ratio}}
   \]$

3. **Margin of Safety (MOS)**: The difference between actual sales and break-even sales.  
   $\[
   \text{MOS} = \text{Sales} - \text{BEP Sales}
   \]$

---

### Step-by-Step Calculations:

#### Given Data:
- Sales (\(S\)) = Rs. 100,000  
- Fixed Costs (\(F\)) = Rs. 30,000  
- Variable Costs (\(V\)) = Rs. 60,000  

---

#### 1. **P/V Ratio**:
$\[
\text{P/V Ratio} = \frac{S - V}{S} \times 100 = \frac{100,000 - 60,000}{100,000} \times 100 = 40\%
\]$

---

#### 2. **Break-Even Point (BEP) Sales**:
$\[
\text{BEP Sales} = \frac{F}{\text{P/V Ratio}} = \frac{30,000}{0.4} = Rs. 75,000
\]$

---

#### 3. **Margin of Safety (MOS)**:
$\[
\text{MOS} = S - \text{BEP Sales} = 100,000 - 75,000 = Rs. 25,000
\]$

---

### Effects of Changes:

#### (i) **20% Increase in Selling Price**:
- New Sales = \(S + 20\% S = 100,000 + 20,000 = Rs. 120,000\)  
- Variable Costs remain the same (\(V = 60,000\)), so:  
  $\[
  \text{New P/V Ratio} = \frac{120,000 - 60,000}{120,000} \times 100 = 50\%
  \]$
  $\[
  \text{New BEP Sales} = \frac{30,000}{0.5} = Rs. 60,000
  \]$
  $\[
  \text{New MOS} = 120,000 - 60,000 = Rs. 60,000
  \]$

---

#### (ii) **10% Decrease in Selling Price**:
- New Sales = \(S - 10\% S = 100,000 - 10,000 = Rs. 90,000\)  
- Variable Costs remain the same (\(V = 60,000\)), so:  
  $\[
  \text{New P/V Ratio} = \frac{90,000 - 60,000}{90,000} \times 100 = 33.33\%
  \]$
  $\[
  \text{New BEP Sales} = \frac{30,000}{0.3333} \approx Rs. 90,000
  \]$
  $\[
  \text{New MOS} = 90,000 - 90,000 = Rs. 0 \, (\text{No Safety Margin})
  \]$

---

#### (iii) **10% Decrease in Fixed Costs**:
- New Fixed Costs = \(F - 10\% F = 30,000 - 3,000 = Rs. 27,000\)  
- P/V Ratio remains the same (\(40\%\)), so:  
  $\[
  \text{New BEP Sales} = \frac{27,000}{0.4} = Rs. 67,500
  \]$
  $\[
  \text{New MOS} = 100,000 - 67,500 = Rs. 32,500
  \]$

---

#### (iv) **10% Decrease in Variable Costs**:
- New Variable Costs = \(V - 10\% V = 60,000 - 6,000 = Rs. 54,000\)  
- P/V Ratio changes:
  $\[
  \text{New P/V Ratio} = \frac{100,000 - 54,000}{100,000} \times 100 = 46\%
  \]$
  $\[
  \text{New BEP Sales} = \frac{30,000}{0.46} \approx Rs. 65,217
  \]$
  $\[
  \text{New MOS} = 100,000 - 65,217 = Rs. 34,783
  \]$

---

#### (v) **10% Increase in Sales Volume**:
- New Sales = \(S + 10\% S = 100,000 + 10,000 = Rs. 110,000\)  
- Variable Costs increase proportionally (\(V + 10\% V = 60,000 + 6,000 = Rs. 66,000\)):  
  $\[
  \text{New Contribution} = 110,000 - 66,000 = Rs. 44,000
  \]$
  $\[
  \text{New MOS} = 110,000 - 75,000 = Rs. 35,000
  \]$

### **Q1: The ratio of variable cost to sales is 70%. The BEP occurs at 60% of total sales. Find the total sales.**

#### **Solution:**

1. **Step 1: Determine P/V Ratio**  
   $\[
   \text{P/V Ratio} = 1 - \frac{\text{Variable Cost}}{\text{Sales}} = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30 \, \text{(30%)}.
   \]$

2. **Step 2: Relationship Between BEP and Total Sales**  
   At BEP, sales are **60% of total sales**, so:  
   $\[
   \text{BEP Sales} = 0.60 \times \text{Total Sales}.
   \]$

3. **Step 3: Break-Even Point Formula**  
   The formula for BEP is:  
   $\[
   \text{BEP Sales} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{P/V Ratio}}.
   \]$

   Substituting BEP Sales:  
   $\[
   0.60 \times \text{Total Sales} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{0.30}.
   \]$

4. **Step 4: Solve for Total Sales**  
   $\[
   \text{Total Sales} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{0.30 \times 0.60} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{0.18}.
   \]$

---

### **Q2: Find the profit**

#### **(i) Margin of Safety (MOS) = 330,000 and P/V Ratio = 30%**

**Formula for Profit**:  
$\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Margin of Safety} \times \text{P/V Ratio}.
\]$

Substitute the given values:  
$\[
\text{Profit} = 330,000 \times 0.30 = 99,000.
\]$

---

#### **(ii) P/V Ratio = 30%, Margin of Safety Ratio = 33.33%, Sales = 990,000, Fixed Costs = 180,000**

**Step 1: Calculate Margin of Safety (MOS)**  
$\[
\text{MOS} = \text{Margin of Safety Ratio} \times \text{Sales}.
\]$
$\[
\text{MOS} = 0.3333 \times 990,000 = 330,000.
\]$

**Step 2: Calculate Profit**  
$\[
\text{Profit} = \text{MOS} \times \text{P/V Ratio}.
\]$
$\[
\text{Profit} = 330,000 \times 0.30 = 99,000.
\]$

---

#### **(iii) Calculate Profit at 75% of Total Sales**

**Step 1: Sales at 75%**  
$\[
\text{Sales at 75%} = 0.75 \times 990,000 = 742,500.
\]$

**Step 2: Contribution at 75% Sales**  
$\[
\text{Contribution} = \text{Sales} \times \text{P/V Ratio}.
\]$
$\[
\text{Contribution} = 742,500 \times 0.30 = 222,750.
\]$

**Step 3: Profit at 75% Sales**  
$\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Contribution} - \text{Fixed Costs}.
\]$$
\[
\text{Profit} = 222,750 - 180,000 = 42,750.
\]$

---

### **Final Answers:**

1. **Q1 (Total Sales)**:  
   $\[
   \text{Total Sales} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{0.18} \, \text{(value depends on Fixed Costs provided)}.
   \]$

2. **Q2 (Profit Calculations)**:  
   - (i) **Profit (MOS = 330,000)**: Rs. **99,000**.  
   - (ii) **Profit (MOS Ratio = 33.33%)**: Rs. **99,000**.  
   - (iii) **Profit at 75% Sales**: Rs. **42,750**.
